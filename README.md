So, this is sort of hacked together from a lot of data sources and the
code is a mess.  Here's a hello world of how to get up and running.

1. Install Python requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Download database and hints from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1irIGhNo8wb5iWZp5E10Bd3mbbzjwyiV9/view?usp=sharing, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w9AtFIo5UlQ7CB-10tv_xzk-gxNVnTwo/view?usp=sharing), and put them in the dictionary.

3. Run `python semantle.py` for the web server.
